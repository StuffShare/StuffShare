{"name":"Stuffshare","tagline":"Web2Py application designed to share personal belongings","body":"StuffShare allows users to create a catalogue of all their belongings, with specific details about each item. Users also select the visibility of each item, which defines which other users on StuffShare can access its details. The central idea of StuffShare is allowing users to lend out and borrow personal belongings to and from one another, and maintain a personal catalogue of their belongings they cannot track in person. Visibility allows users to define what items their friends can see and what items are available to the general public. By marking items as private, users can also simply use the website to maintain a record of their belongings.\r\n\r\nUsers maintain a list of friends and items, which can limit the visibility of certain items to avoid the untrustworthy nature of the Internet. To add friends, similar to other social networking websites, users must request friendship via the user interface. Upon approval, friends may look at each other’s items marked for friend visibility. Items also have two additional visibility options: private and public. They mark what items are only visible to the user and to the rest of the StuffShare community, respectively. The web application also provides external data and parsing from other websites to increase the ease of use of the website. For example, a user can define where the item is available for pick-up, and a Google maps interactive display shall be displayed when viewing the item. Users can also look up information pertaining to books and movies via amazon or imdb.\r\n\r\nThe framework used for development was Web2Py. Web2Py provides easy database querying, built in security functionality and a model-view-controller structure. The backend database is using MySQL. Both the database and application are being hosted on pythonanywhere, as recommended by the authors of the Web2Py framework. The IDE used was PyCharm created by Jetbrains. PyCharm allows development of Web2Py apps, locally run databases to test our change-sets and version control. PyCharm connects to the git repository maintained on SFU’s GitLab server. Web2Py provided everything needed to develop the application, including but not limited to: JQuery, Bootstrap and dynamically generating HTML and CSS code.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
